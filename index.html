            <p>
                Welcome to "The House", a website about our first property in Bristol, it's evolution from the day we moved in
                until three years in. We will give you an insight into how we accomodated, transformed and "populated" the house.
                You will find out how we are making it our own and how we manage the site and the animals.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                We are Abby and Coco, married for 8 years. We bought this property in Bristol in 2019 after making some careful
                calculations comparing rental and mortgage costs. After realising it would be cheaper to work towards owning a 
                property than renting, we set off on our search. It didn't take long before we found this house and immediately
                fell in love with it. The interior was well designed and the garden quite big. The view out the back onto a field 
                brought peace to our minds. We moved in with our two cats and dwarf rabbit, quickly settling in and deciding on
                priorities. It wasn't long before we decided to take in a dog (no enough with three pets) and as times passed we 
                found ourselves in the position to foster a snake and two chicken. The garden was, although the main attraction 
                in our eyes, the part that needed the most work as it was all cement and stones and we desired our own patch of 
                nature. Follow us on our transformation adventures!
